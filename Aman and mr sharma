much horlicks his mother mixed in his milk today.If his mother has mixed x grams of horlicks,then Aman will be capable of running 100*x meters 
at most on that day.

Aman's instructor, Mr.Sharma ,is a very strict yet very caring.Everyday he asks Aman to run around a circle of radius r once.If Aman is able
to complete the circle,he would get a toffee.

Note:Take value of pie=22/7.

CONSTRAINTS:

1<=d<105

1<=r<106

1<=x<=104

INPUT:

First line contains d,no. of days Aman goes to his instructor.Next d lines each contain r,radius of circle and x,amount of horlicks.

OUTPUT:
